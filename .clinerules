# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Responsive Design and Mobile-First Approach

- Implement a mobile-first design strategy for all components and pages.
- Ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop displays.
- Use Tailwind CSS breakpoints consistently for responsive design.

## Mobile and Tablet Header Layout

- In mobile and tablet screen modes, implement a header with the following structure:
  - Logo positioned on the left side of the header.
  - Mobile menu (hamburger icon) positioned on the right side of the header.
- Ensure the mobile menu is easily accessible and follows best practices for mobile UX.
- Use Shadcn UI components or custom Tailwind classes to create a consistent and visually appealing header.

## Desktop Header Layout

- For desktop screens, adapt the header layout as needed while maintaining brand consistency.
- Ensure smooth transitions between mobile/tablet and desktop layouts.

## Page Creation and Verification

- Before running the application, verify that all necessary pages have been created.
- Implement a checklist or automated script to ensure all required pages are present.
- Include comments at the top of each page file indicating its purpose and any dependencies.

## Navigation and Routing

- Implement consistent navigation patterns across all screen sizes.
- Ensure that the mobile menu provides access to all main navigation items.
- Use React Router or a similar routing solution to manage page navigation.

## Testing Responsive Design

- Regularly test the application on various devices and screen sizes.
- Use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes during development.
- Implement automated tests for responsive behavior where possible.

Remember to thoroughly test the responsive design, especially the header layout and mobile menu functionality, across various devices and screen sizes. Prioritize a seamless user experience on mobile devices while ensuring the design scales effectively to larger screens.
